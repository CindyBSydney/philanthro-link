                <p>Floods in Kenya are a recurring natural disaster, often caused by heavy rainfall, overflowing rivers, or inadequate drainage systems, especially in urban areas. Kenya typically experiences two rainy seasons: the long rains from March to May and the short rains from October to December. </p>
                <p>During these periods, flooding can occur, leading to displacement of people, destruction of property, loss of lives, and disruption of infrastructure and livelihoods. </p>
